A stone door!☟

So! This was what they meant by all of☟
that ”[Green]source of the flow[White]” business!☟
Well, this waterfall certainly is the☟
source of all Hyrule's water.☟
According to [Green]King Gustaf[White], the final☟

We've dawdled long enough, [Link0]!☟
Let's go find that element!☛

Let's go find it!☛


//POINTER #34 @ $9BF158 - STRING #34 @ $9C0747

Now how do you build something☟

It's worth a shot, [Link0]!☛

Everyone in the castle, all just☟

This can only be the work of that evil☟

We must use the power of the sacred☟

Mustn't forget the hats.☛


//POINTER #41 @ $9C2DD8 - STRING #41 @ $9C4ABD

#W32($9C2DD8)
These Mountain [Green]Minish [White]sure are☟
hard workers!☟
We should work just as hard and sing☟
a spiffy little song, like they do!☟
What do you think? Hey! Kid...?☟
Are you still listening to me?☛


//POINTER #42 @ $9C2DDC - STRING #42 @ $9C4B79

#W32($9C2DDC)
This isn't the time to idle about,☟
you lazy boy!☟
We have to go search for the [Red]elements[White]☟
while Melari works on that sword!☛


//POINTER #43 @ $9C2DE0 - STRING #43 @ $9C4BF9

#W32($9C2DE0)
So humans made this mine long ago?☟
☟
Well it's full of monsters now,☟
kid, so watch your back!☛


//POINTER #44 @ $9C2DE4 - STRING #44 @ $9C4C59

#W32($9C2DE4)
Perhaps the humans who made this mine☟
will have left some things we can use...[010A]☟
[0101]After all, there's no reason to let☟
good wares go to waste.☛


//POINTER #45 @ $9C2DE8 - STRING #45 @ $9C4CEB

#W32($9C2DE8)
So we beat the fire monster and got☟
the second [Red]element[White]! Incredible![010A]☟
[0101]Kid, you may just be some kind of☟
hero or something!☟
♫[008D]I knew I sensed potential in you!☛


//POINTER #46 @ $9C2DEC - STRING #46 @ $9C4D94

#W32($9C2DEC)
Oh, so I bet [Green]Melari [White]has finished with☟
that [Red]sword[White]. We should go pick it up!☛


//POINTER #47 @ $9C2DF0 - STRING #47 @ $9C4DEA

#W32($9C2DF0)
So how about that sword that [Green]Melari[White]☟
fixed up for you, huh?☟
I may be just a hat, but I can admire☟
good craftsmanship!☛


//POINTER #48 @ $9C2DF4 - STRING #48 @ $9C4E66

#W32($9C2DF4)
We must find the [Green]elemental sanctuary[White]☟
to fill the sword with elemental power.☟
I'd never have looked for the [Green]elemental☟
sanctuary[White] in [Green]Hyrule Castle[White], though![010A]☟
[0101]You know how to get there, right?☟
Let's go!☛


//POINTER #49 @ $9C2DF8 - STRING #49 @ $9C4F3E

#W32($9C2DF8)
So of the four [Red]elements[White], we've got☟
Earth and Fire...☟
And now, we have the [Red]White Sword[White]☟
to absorb their power!☟
That means the sacred blade's power☟
has almost been restored!☛


//POINTER #50 @ $9C2DFC - STRING #50 @ $9C4FF4

#W32($9C2DFC)
Why do you look so confused? Don't you☟
understand what's going on?[010A]☟
[0101]The [Green]elemental sanctuary [White]exists between☟
the human world and the Minish world.☟
Here, let me explain with a little☟
example: in a ham sandwich...☟
the elemental sanctuary would be the☟
ham between the two slices of bread!☟
...You've still got that look.☟
Did I just make it more confusing?☛


//POINTER #51 @ $9C2E00 - STRING #51 @ $9C515C

#W32($9C2E00)
So! We must infuse the [Red]White Sword[White]☟
with the [Red]elemental power[White].[010A]☟
[0101]That means we must find the☟
[Green]elemental sanctuary[White].☟
And the way we do that is... Um...☟
Well, I'm sure we'll figure it out!☛


//POINTER #52 @ $9C2E04 - STRING #52 @ $9C5224

#W32($9C2E04)
I think that you and I may be the only☟
ones who can see the mystic doorway...☟
Well, that's fine by me. That means☟
no one will notice anything unusual!☛


//POINTER #53 @ $9C2E08 - STRING #53 @ $9C52BE

#W32($9C2E08)
We just need to infuse the [Red]sword[White] with☟
the power of these two [Red]elements[White].☟
Then, the sacred blade will be☟
nearly complete!☛


//POINTER #54 @ $9C2E0C - STRING #54 @ $9C5340

#W32($9C2E0C)
Only two [Red]elements[White] remain!☟
☟
They must be in the places marked on☟
your [Red]map[White] by the Minish elder!☟
Why don't we take another look at that☟
map? If memory serves me correctly...[010A]☟
[0101]There should be a mark out on the☟
westernmost edge of [Green]Castor Wilds[White].☛


//POINTER #55 @ $9C2E10 - STRING #55 @ $9C5442

#W32($9C2E10)
So the [Red]sacred blade[White] has finally started☟
to show us a portion of its power!☟
If we use this new skill of yours well,☟
we should be able to access new areas!☛


//POINTER #56 @ $9C2E14 - STRING #56 @ $9C54E3

#W32($9C2E14)
If you're after the [Red]elements[White], just☟
check your [Red]map[White] by pressing START.☟
I believe the elder of the Forest☟
Minish marked the locations there.☛


//POINTER #57 @ $9C2E18 - STRING #57 @ $9C5578

#W32($9C2E18)
Hrm... According to the map, we'll need☟

That unexplored region is where we☟

[Link0], how long has it been since☟

Your grandfather must be worried.☟
Why don't you show your face at home?☟

Hoho! Well...☟
☟

Hey, [Link0]. I've been up here for☟

Where could we go to learn a little☟
more about that?☛


//POINTER #65 @ $9C2E38 - STRING #65 @ $9C5A76

#W32($9C2E38)
So about that old lady in the woods☟
named [Green]Syrup[White] or something...☟
Didn't she strike you as a little☟
bit, well, strange?☟
I'm confident that her [Red]potions[White] work☟

She looks like someone who could whip☟
up a mean magic brew...☛


//POINTER #66 @ $9C2E3C - STRING #66 @ $9C5B70

Once we cross [Green]Castor Wilds[White], the☟

All we have to do is use the [Red]Ocarina of☟

Maybe those people who say the Minish☟

Hey! [Link0]! What's that look for?☟
Don't tell me you were one of...them?☟

[Link0], I'm sure you can handle it!☟
Don't get me wrong! I'd love to help!☟

bringing humans powerful magic.☟
With the magic light force and the☟
Picori Blade, the beasts were repelled.☟
And the world of humans once more☟
knew peace, thanks to the Picori.☟
So as not to forget our gratitude, we☟
hold this festival each year.☟

You know, fusing [Blue]Kinstone pieces[White] can☟
get you more than mere [Red]Rupees[White]...☟
It can call new people to a place or☟
